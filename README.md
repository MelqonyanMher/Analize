 How you know we depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use. 
Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, 
forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change.Yet,
four out of five wildfires are started by people, nature is usually more than happy to help fan the flames. 
Dry weather and drought convert green vegetation into bone-dry, 
flammable fuel; strong winds spread fire quickly over land; and warm temperatures encourage combustion.
 So we need to count fire risk and warn people to be carefull.For this case I develop program that take data from DataBase and 
 show FireRiskLevel for Today for all regions of Country...
